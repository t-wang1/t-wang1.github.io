### Introduction 

Debate events like LD and policy frequently involve spreading (aka speed-reading). The purpose? Try to cram as many arguments as possible. The challenge? Maintain coherence while doing it. This program allows the user to upload an audio file and have OpenAIâ€™s Whisper API transcribe it and give it a grade so the user can see how coherent they are.
