### Introduction 

Debate events like LD and policy frequently involve spreading (aka speed-reading). The purpose? Try to cram as many arguments as possible. The challenge? Maintain coherence while doing it. This program allows the user to upload an audio file and have OpenAI’s whisper API transcribe so the user can see how coherent they are

### Get Started 

1. run python3 spreading.py
2. open http://localhost:3000
3. upload an audio file (works with mp3, mp4, and wav files)
4. the ‘transcription.txt’ file should appear in your root directory
