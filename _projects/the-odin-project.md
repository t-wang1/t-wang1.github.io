### Introduction

I started The Odin Project in September of 2022. For the first few months I was pretty consistent about it, dutifully waking up and working on it for about a hour and a half before my first class. Throughout the semester as work started to pile up, I spent less and less time on it. Eventually it faded out of my schedule entirely. But I had always planned on finishing it at some point, and so I hope that this keeps me accountable.
