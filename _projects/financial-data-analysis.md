### Introduction

Most people who know me know that I’m a coffee enthusiast. In fact, you can probably find me at a cafe two to three times a week. Unfortunately for me (and my wallet) lattes aren’t exactly inexpensive. Most personal finance gurus, notably Graham Stephen, are proponents of 20 cent iced coffees (read: ditch the coffee shop and make your own coffee). While I’m certainly not giving up my coffee anytime soon I decided to see just how much my ROI would be if I were to invest my money into SBUX instead. 

### Dataset

Plotting Starbuck’s adjusted close price for the past five years, there’s been a 117.87% increase despite some dips.
