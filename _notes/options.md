### General Idea

Options are _hedging_ instruments. **Calls** gives an individual/entity the right, but not the obligation to _buy_ an asset at the strike before a specified expiration date. The buyer effectively makes a profit if the value of the asset increases. Alternatively, **puts** give an individual/entity the right, but not the obligation to _sell_ an asset at the strike price before the expiration date. The seller makes a profit as the value of the asset decreases. 

### Liquidity

Generally speaking, the tighter the spread and the larger the volume of contracts the more liquid an asset is.

### Forward Prices 

Options are based on the foward prices of the underlying assets. To calculate the forward price, we use: $$F = Se^{rt}$$ where $F$ is the forward value of an instrument $S$, $t$ is time (in years) and $r$ is the interest rate
