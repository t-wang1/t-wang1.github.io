### Sets, Relations, and Languages

A binary relation R $$\subseteq$$ A x A is an equivalence relation defined in the set A if and only if it's reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  

Two sets A and B are **equinumerous** denoted **A~B** if and only if there's a bijection function f: A $$\rarr$$ B such that A is 1-1 and onto.
