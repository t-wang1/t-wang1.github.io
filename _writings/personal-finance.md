### Introduction

For as long as I can remember, personal finance has always been a topic that’s of great interest to me. I was a voracious consumer of the [r/fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/) subreddit and would spend a few hours just scrolling through it. After reading _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_ in my sophomore year of high school I created an account on investopedia to simulate what it would be like to invest with $100,000. Of course since the money was all fictitious, I was nowhere as risk averse as I am now. 

I decided to log all my thoughts/questions (and answers) here to reinforce my learning. 

<details>
    <summary> Is DCA actually a good strat? </summary>
    <p> The short answer: investing a lump sum <a href = "https://www.northwesternmutual.com/life-and-money/is-dollar-cost-averaging-better-than-lump-sum-investing">outperforms</a> dollar-cost averaging. The longer answer: it depends on a myriad of factors - current financial situation, market volatility, etc. </p>

    <summary> Concentration v. Diversification </summary>
    <p> Diversify if you don’t know what you’re doing. If you’re an above average investor, concentration will work in your favor. </p>

<details>
    <summary> Is the MACD indicator any good? </summary>
    <p> The general consensus: it's useful but a trader can get whipsawed several times before it adequately captures a change in momemtum. The result: small gains or possibly losses </p>
