For as long as I can remember, personal finance has always been a topic thatâ€™s of great interest to me. I was a voracious consumer of the r/fire subreddit and would spend a good deal of time idealizing my multiple streams of income. After reading _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_ in my sophomore year of high school I created an account on investopedia to simulate what it would be like to invest with $100,000. Of course since the money was all fictitious, I was nowhere as risk averse as I am now. 

I decided to log all my questions (and answers) here to reinforce my learning. This is definitely not intended to be financial advice and most of sources will likely be from reddit so take that as you will.
