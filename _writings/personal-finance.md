### Introduction

For as long as I can remember, personal finance has always been a topic thatâ€™s of great interest to me. I was a voracious consumer of the r/fire subreddit and would spend a good deal of time idealizing my multiple streams of income. After reading _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_ in my sophomore year of high school I created an account on investopedia to simulate what it would be like to invest with $100,000. Of course since the money was all fictitious, I was nowhere as risk averse as I am now. 

I decided to log all my questions (and answers) here to reinforce my learning.

    <p> The short answer: investing a lump sum <a href = "https://www.northwesternmutual.com/life-and-money/is-dollar-cost-averaging-better-than-lump-sum-investing"> outperforms </a> dollar-cost averaging. The longer answer: it depends on a myriad of factors - current financial situation, market volatility, etc. </p>
