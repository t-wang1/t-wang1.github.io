the mile run was a dreaded rite of passage for every single nyc public high school kid. and every year, without fail, i would walk at least half of it. most of my friends tried out for the track team at some point in their high school career. some stayed and others quit - either because of the time commitment or for some reason or another. but for four years, i never felt inclined to run. 

i took up running during a stressful semester. it was the only time that i could put my thoughts on pause and instead focus on just how damn hard running is. my first run was 10 minutes at a relatively slow pace and boy was it brutal. my face was red with exertion and i was sweating profusely. i didn’t feel the so called “runner’s high” and honestly i felt just meh.

i went running again the next day. it wasn’t so much that running was enjoyable (because it wasn’t) but i felt compelled to prove to myself that i could be disciplined enough to do the things i didn’t want to do. this mentality drove most of my actions in freshman year. i would wake up at 5am every morning, even though i know i didn’t get enough sleep, just to prove to myself that i could do it. and well it certainly wasn’t a surprise to myself when i wasn’t so productive at five in the morning.
