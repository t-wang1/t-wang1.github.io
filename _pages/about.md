I’m a sophomore at Stony Brook University majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. I'm interested in programming languages and functional programming. My research in the [Automotive Ethics Lab](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/vertically-integrated-projects/teams/_team_page/team_page.php?team=Automotive%20Ethics) involves establishing edge cases that test autonomous vehicle against distinct ethical theories.

### What's This?

This website serves as a repository for any notes, projects, and writings. Additionally, I'm a believer that writing helps crystallizes thoughts and ideas and so this is a medium through which I can practice those skills. 

### Mindset

Something that I think is frequently overlooked and understated in its importance. The right mindset is conducive to completing any short or long term goal. Here are a few that I always come back to:

- Put yourself in places you don’t belong. When you start before you’re ready, reality shifts drastically.
- You won’t always feel motivated. Practice discipline.
- Progress isn’t always linear, but continue to put in the work.
