I'm a sophomore at Stony Brook University majoring in Computer Science and Economics. I'm broadly interested in the design and implementation of programming languages. My research in the [Automotive Ethics Lab](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/vertically-integrated-projects/teams/_team_page/team_page.php?team=Automotive%20Ethics) involves establishing edge cases that test our autonomous vehicle against distinct ethical theories.
