I’m a senior at Stony Brook University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence.

### What's This?

This site serves as a repository for any notes, projects, and writings. I'm a firm believer that writing helps crystallize thoughts and ideas and so this is a medium through which I can practice those skills. 

### Mindset

Something that I think is frequently overlooked and understated in its importance. The right mindset is conducive to completing any short or long term goal. Here are a few that I always come back to:

- Put yourself in places you don’t belong. When you start before you’re ready, reality shifts drastically.
- You won’t always feel motivated. Practice discipline.
- Progress isn’t always linear, but continue to put in the work.
